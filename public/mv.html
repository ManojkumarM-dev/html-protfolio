<h1>The Best Movies According to Manojkumar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies off all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Aayirathil oruvan</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time by Selvaraghavan.</p>
<h3>Visaranai</h3>
<p>It is a political thriller by Vetrimaaran</p>
<h3>Manmatha Leelai</h3>
<p>A movie, which I feel, is a different experiment and gutsy for its time</p>
